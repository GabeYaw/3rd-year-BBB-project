###How to run code (incomplete and not working instructions):
1. Check Requirement.txt file is saved in root directory of the whole repo. I don't think it can be saved in the code folder
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it. - (python3 -m venv .venv) then (source env/bin/activate)
3. Install the requirements from the Requirements.txt file in the terminal - (pip install -r
requirements.txt)
