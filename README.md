## How to run code (incomplete and not working instructions):
1. Check Requirement.txt file is saved in root directory of the whole repo. I don't think it can be saved in the code folder
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it. - (python3 -m venv myenv) then (source myenv/bin/activate)
3. Install the requirements from the Requirements.txt file in the terminal - (pip install -r requirements.txt)
4. When coming back to the file reactivate the original virtual environment with this. You most likely don't need steps 1-3 in general. (myenv/bin/activate)
