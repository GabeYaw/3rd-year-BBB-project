\section{Progress this week}
\begin{frame}{Progress this week}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Set up Github repo
            \begin{itemize}
                \item I can share the link if that is useful.
            \end{itemize}
        \item Begun project outline
        \item Filled in risk assessment
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Very short, I think it needs to be signed by a supervisor before submitting. 
            \end{itemize}
        \item Read and skimmed through papers
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Problems this week}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Attempted to run code
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Had some issues installing \emph{dmipy} package which I resolved
        \item It would be useful to have Snigdha's requirements file so that I know it will run correctly.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I've switched to Python 3.8 and she is using 3.7, which didn't have a download link as it was no longer supported.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Had a run time error with the code that Snigdha shared.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Switched \emph{num\_worker} from 2 to 0 and it ran. 
            \end{itemize}
        \item I can run 380 lines out of 400 before getting type errors when calculating the mean.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I managed to get to this stage this afternoon, so haven't had the chance to resolve it yet. I think there's an issue with arguments in the numpy mean function.
        \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
