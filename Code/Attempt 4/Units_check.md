## Lizzie's Matlab code
bf =    0-250   * 1e6    [s/m2]
be =    0-250   * 1e6    [s/m2]
tm =    20-400  * 1e-3   [s]

ADC =   0.1-3.5 * 1e-9   [m2/s]
Sigma = 0-1              [a.u.]
AXR =   0.1-20           [s-1]

## NN and sim files in python
bf =    0-250   * 1e3   [ms/um2] or [ks/m2]
be =    0-250   * 1e3   [ms/um2] or [ks/m2]
Possible mistake with be and be! I had 1e-3 but I think it is 1e3

tm =    20-400  * 1e-3   [s]

ADC =   0.1-3.5          [um2/ms] or [ms/m2]
Sigma = 0-1              [a.u.]
AXR =   0.1-20           [s-1]
